Local Maxima Ended
Description

Given an array of n elements, find out the number of elements in the array which are local maxima.

A local maxima is defined as an element that is greater than it's immediate neighbors (Do not consider the first and the last element since they have only one neighbor).

For example, an ith element has (i+1) and (i-1) as it's immediate neighbors.

Also, if the number of the elements is less than 3, then print -1 since it's not possible.


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the number of mountains peaks in the valley.

The second line contains n integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) - the height of each mountain peak.


Output
For each test case, print the answer: The number of local maxima if n > 2 or else -1.
