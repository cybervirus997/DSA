Just find minimum -9479:12:14
Description

You are given N which is the number of different types of operation you need to perform on a stack. There are 3 different types of operations:

PUSH V: Here V is an integer which you need to push in the stack

POP: Here POP out the top element from stack. (In case stack is empty print "EMPTY")

MIN: Print the minimum value present in the stack


Input
Input Format

First line contains N which is the number of operations you need to perform on stack

Next N line contains one of the 3 operations mentioned above

Constraints

N < 1000000

V < 100




Output
Output Format

The output consists of a line containing an integer with the smallest present value in the stack for queries of type "MIN" or "EMPTY" for "MIN" and "POP" operations when the stack is empty.
